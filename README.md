# ‚ö° Boosting Algorithms in Machine Learning

This notebook demonstrates the concept, implementation, and evaluation of **Boosting algorithms**, one of the most powerful ensemble techniques in supervised machine learning. Boosting improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple weak learners into a strong model.

1. **Import Libraries**  
   Use libraries like Scikit-learn, XGBoost, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

2. **Dataset Loading & Preprocessing**  
   Clean and prepare data for training.

3. **Implement Boosting Models**
   - Train models using AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, etc.
   - Visualize training performance

4. **Prediction & Evaluation**
   - Compare models using:
     - Accuracy
